      <h3>My name is Massimo and I am in love with technologies. I grew up in Italy, and graduated with an Assicateâ€™s degree in graphic Electronic and Telecomunications in 2000. I've always love IT and since I graduate my passion for it grown and I started worked as IT tech since to end up to study for Computer Science. </h3>

<h3>My story is pretty much like every other kid that grew up in the 70's and early 80's: Saturday morning cartoons, Super Soakers in the summer, bowls of sugar laced cereals, fighter jet shaped fruit snacks, Commander Mark and The Secret City, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Disney Afternoons and a lot of Asian Cartoon. Those early obsessions have influenced my work and life permanently.</h3>

<h3>After I graduated college, I worked for the national telecomunication company in Italy, to start my career. Since I moved to US I decided to go back to school and get another degree in IT field in order to have a nicer job when I get to old .</h3>
